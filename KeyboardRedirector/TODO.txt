KeyboardRedirector TODO list
----------------------------

- Complete HID key detection
  - Add HIDEvent to InputDevice
  - Add options to disable particular HID devices from being captured (Belkin UPS sends HID events every few seconds)

- Fix cross threaded operation for updating form elements to invoke all actions.

- Add configuation of RC6 MCE remote control keys (see MCERemoteMapper)
    ReportMappingTable format details - http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=Using_a_Microsoft_remote_control_in_Windows
    
- Add capturing of WM_APPCOMMAND events
  - Not per keyboard, just low level like for low level keyboard events.
  
- Add customizing how windows deals with MW_APPCOMMAND actions
  - Option for disabling the Human Interface Device Access (hidserv) service.
      This service is the one that turns key events from usage page 0x0C into WM_APPCOMMAND events.
  - Easy customization of registry entries in
    HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/AppKey
    or HKCU
    specifications - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463446.aspx

- Build ApplicationLauncher into KeyboardRedirector so that it can load faster.
  - Also fix errors if mapped drives are missing for shortcuts.

- Add the ability to send WM_COMMAND messages directly to the application in focus.

- Possibly add the ability to capture key sequences that occur withing X milliseconds. (for bar code readers)
